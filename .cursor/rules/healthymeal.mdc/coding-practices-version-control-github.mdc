## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Version Control

#### GitHub

- Use pull request templates to standardize information provided for code reviews
- Implement branch protection rules for {{protected_branches}} to enforce quality checks
- Configure required status checks to prevent merging code that fails tests or linting
- Use GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows to automate testing and deployment
- Implement CODEOWNERS files to automatically assign reviewers based on code paths
- Use GitHub Projects for tracking work items and connecting them to code changes
