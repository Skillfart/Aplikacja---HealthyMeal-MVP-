## Coding practices

### Guidelines for Documentation

#### Storybook

- Organize stories by component hierarchy to mirror the application structure
- Implement comprehensive controls to showcase component variations for {{component_types}}
- Use MDX format to combine documentation and live examples for complex components
- Configure Storybook addons for accessibility, responsive design, and {{specific_testing_needs}}
- Implement design token integration to showcase components with different themes
- Create interaction tests to verify component behavior in addition to visual appearance
